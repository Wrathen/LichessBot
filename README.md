# LichessBot
Bot for Lichess.com. It's for fun and education. Under development.

--> Added All Pieces' Movements At The Moment.

--> White can make random moves via a button.

--> Still under development. More to come.


- Edit (2020): THIS was the project that got me into optimizing code. What I did here is an absolute mess. Luckily, I've learnt alot about optimizing afterwards. I won't continue this project (probably). Instead approaching pieces or the board as bytes, I actually made all pieces a class and each piece on the board was an object. A lot of strings, a lot of integers, a lot of unneccesary stuff = Very VERY slow code when I compared this to another project.
